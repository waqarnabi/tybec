=======================

/* ver1 */
+ single kernel (no CG pipeline)
+ may not be suitable for DSE at tytra-CL stage


/* ver2 */
+ re-forest the SOR kernel, for finer-grained, multiple CG kernels

/* ver3 */
+ Artificially inserting iterative units to test with Tytra-CL optimizations 
(no longer functionally compatible with baseline C unless I make it)
