=======================

This is the first test-case for TyBEC-17. 
It is based on the synthetic example used for the HiPEAC-2017 paper  (see ./doc).

In more or less the same form, it also appears in the ../201612_TyTra17upgrade_Smache project.

The example is designed to be as simple as possible, yet which exposes the patterns that we want to experiment with.
Specifically, maps and folds on parallel paths, splits and merges, offsets between peer kernels, etc. 
The computation kernels are kept as simple as possible for now (single integer instruction in most cases), but 
more complex kernels can be tested as within the same template.
