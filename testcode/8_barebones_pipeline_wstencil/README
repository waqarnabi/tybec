=======================

This a synthetic, barebones example to test stencil code, which should lead to creation of streaming buffers. I am not considering static-buffering for stencils here though.

FORTRAN has not been written. 
TODO: Do fortran so that can test with  Wim's tool.

NOTE: The meaning of i and j is opposite in C (i is rows, j is cols) vs TIR (i is cols, j is rows)

BUILD & RUN (C and Fortran)
------------
0. cd ./c (./fortran)
1. scons
2. ./barebonesStencil.exe

TIR VERSIONS
------------
See ./tir/README
