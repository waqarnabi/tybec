To run TYBEC: tybec.pl --i coriolis.tirl --g --cio --iov <vect-factor>

## NOTE ## Most versions do not differ in the source TIR, but only in the flags, code generation templates, and other back-end related features used, all of which happens after you run tybec on them locally. So all versions may not be available if you are seeing this in a repo.


* ver 1 *
+ Vanilla, mode = 1 (no cordics, i.e. no sine/cosine)
+ Done only for costing (for Cris's paper, Reconfig, 2019)

* ver 2 *
+ This is for fully functional code generation and testing with vectorization on HW
+ I add a grid in the problem (rather than a sinle point) in order to have a mappable stream of inputs I can
experimetn with. This means we are no longer interested in the motion of just one point, but a complete 2D grid.

* ver 3 *
+ Same as ver2, only now experimenting with vectorization


#-------------------
# ver 4 - ver 15, 
# NEW template generated from sdaccel 2018.2
# discarded as did not give peformance improvement for vectorization
# NOTE: size _is_ baked into the FPGA config. Re-synthesis required if you want to change it

#-------------------
# ver 20 - , 
# back to OLD template, based on sdaccel githib repos
#NOTE: SIZE _no_ longer baked into the FPGA config, so can change just by updating host

#-------------------
verX: manual version for testing with NEW template (gen from sdaccel). discarded
verY: manual version for resting with OLD template (function ok now - 2019.07.31 - so now basing code gen on this templae)
