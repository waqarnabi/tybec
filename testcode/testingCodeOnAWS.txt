+ The pre-synthesize code on AWS was not working for some odd reason. Seemed like the correct AFI wasnt loaded first, so I tried this:


sudo fpga-describe-local-image -S 0
sudo fpga-load-local-image -S 0 -I <Your AGFI ID>

where:

for vect2
afi-02983b4170ad29fad
agfi-0b4d6da29c987c718

vect16
agfi-0cd30adf3b89f3853

But then I still got some error (PCI Bar Memory)
