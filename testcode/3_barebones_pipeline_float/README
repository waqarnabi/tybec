=======================

This is the zeroth test-case for TyBEC-17. 
It is a synthetic, barebones example to get the entire flow working (all the way to rtl and opencl-wrapper generation).
This is the FLOAT version of testcode #0

The example is designed to be the absolute barebones case and does not expose most of the issues we are actually interesting in w.r.t smart caching, scheduling and synchronization. Basically we are following the prototyping approach.

FORTRAN has not been written. 

BUILD & RUN (C and Fortran)
------------
0. cd ./c (./fortran)
1. scons
2. ./barebones.exe

TIR VERSIONS
