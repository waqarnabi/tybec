=======================

This a synthetic, barebones example to Opencl (kernel) code to TIR (via LLVM-IR)
and then on the sdx solution.

Based on MSc student project, Fall 2018

BUILD & RUN (C and Fortran)
------------
>> cd ./ocl 
>> run_ocl2tir.sh kernels_channels.cl

LIMITATIONS (as of 2019.02.11)
-------------------------------
+ Ocl kernel code only
+ Using global scope channels (AOCL style)
+ Scalarized kernels
+ No loops or branches
+ An (ugly) hack to differentiate between input and ouput memory streams in the opencl kernel code
  + the last 3 characters of identifier of *output* streams MUST be "out" (case insensitive)
+  Another hack:  all stream sizes currently hardwired to 1024 WORDS
  + at least use __attribute__ like I do in my c2llvm2tir
