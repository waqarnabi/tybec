-----------------------

+ In addition to being a testcode for tybec:
+ I am using this for generating costs of opaque funcs for Cris's work.
+ Note that for the c2llvm2tir pass, I am using a combination of gen  the LLVM-IR code, then manually using parts of
it that are useful to generate the TuTra-Ir (I could probably automate that quickly)
+ So in my ./tir folder, the tir files are part automated, part manually written

+ Things I need to do to the C code to make the LLVM-IR behave:
- Write  floating point constants like this: eg. 5.0f (otherwise LLVM-IR is cluttered with double-float converions
- have a stub definition of ABS/fabs function that is used in the code
