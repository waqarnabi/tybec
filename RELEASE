TYBEC Release R16.0
==================

Date  : 2017.01.13
By    : Waqar Nabi

1. Strictly Internal release.

2. RAW results

3. ROOFLINE estimate now incorporated, and tex file of plot is generated as  well. The older EWIT calculation is  still there
too though.

4. This is the final "TIR-16" version before I make major changes for TIR-17 (i.e. merge manage and computer ir, new  syntax for accessing memories inside kernels, smart buffering)

TYBEC Release History
=====================

TYBEC Release 0.03
==================

Date  : 2016.10.01
By    : Waqar Nabi

1. Strictly Internal release.

2. Used for RECONFIG-2015 and FPGA-2016 results

3. Key update is a cleanup of the compiler code, and a fresh approach to the analysis stage which uses the new "callGraph" hash to analyse
at the END of the parse operation, rather than interleaving analysis with parsing.

4. Some other updates to cost model as well.

5. Peer-kernel code-generation in process, but not completed.

6. New feature allowing hardware specs to be entered as a hash table, which in turn informs esimate(), showing us percentage utilization of resources, bandwidth etc.

7. Release-trigger is the requirement for more formal documentation of TyTra-IR and the cost model, along with the expected changes.


TYBEC Release 0.02
==================

Date  : 2015.03.11
By    : Waqar Nabi

1. Strictly Internal release.

2. Used for HLFPGA 2015 (Parco) results.

3. Tested on SOR. Not tested beyond but should work with similar complexity examples.

4. TyBEC-estimator is operational, and good enough results for HEART.

5. TyBEC-code generator is also operations, and has been tested for synthesis and simulation. Code-generator emits limited design that can work on LocalMem only. No GMem or CPU streams yyet. Also no peer kernels.

6. BATCH MODE introduced, where multiple TIRL files in a folder can be compiled with a single command, and their estimates compiled in a single LOG file.


TYBEC Release 0.01
==================

Date  : 2016.03.11
By    : Waqar Nabi

1. First release of TyBEC. Strictly Internal release.

2. Used for HEART 2015 results.

3. Can parse simpleVectorOps example, and relaxBodo. Not tested beyond these examples but should work with similar complexity examples.

4. TyBEC-estimator is operational, and good enough results for HEART.

5. The release has file for code-generator, but is work in progress for this release.
